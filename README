This code defines two models: MassAirdropContactListRel and MassAirdropContact.

MassAirdropContactListRel is an intermediate model between mass airdrop list and mass airdrop contact. It indicates whether a contact is opted out for a particular list. This model has the following fields:

contact_id: a many-to-one field to airdrop.contact model indicating the contact that is associated with the subscription
list_id: a many-to-one field to airdrop.list model indicating the airdrop list associated with the subscription
opt_out: a boolean field indicating whether the contact has chosen not to receive mails anymore from this list
unsubscription_date: a datetime field indicating the date the contact opted out of the list
message_bounce: a related field to the message_bounce field of airdrop.contact model
is_blacklisted: a related field to the is_blacklisted field of airdrop.contact model
MassAirdropContactListRel has two methods:

create: a method that overrides the default create method to set the unsubscription_date field when a contact opts out of a list
write: a method that overrides the default write method to set the unsubscription_date field when a contact opts out of a list
MassAirdropContact is a model of a contact. This model is different from the partner model because it holds only some basic information: name, email. The purpose is to be able to deal with large contact lists to email without bloating the partner base. This model has the following fields:

name: a char field representing the name of the contact
company_name: a char field representing the company name of the contact
title_id: a many-to-one field to res.partner.title model representing the title of the contact
email: a char field representing the email of the contact
list_ids: a many-to-many field to airdrop.list model representing the airdrop lists the contact is associated with
subscription_list_ids: a one-to-many field to airdrop.contact.subscription model representing the subscription information of the contact for different lists
country_id: a many-to-one field to res.country model representing the country of the contact
tag_ids: a many-to-many field to res.partner.category model representing the tags of the contact
opt_out: a boolean field indicating whether the contact has chosen not to receive mails anymore from a particular list. This field should not be used in a view without a unique and active airdrop list context.
MassAirdropContact has several methods:

default_get: a method that sets the default value for subscription_list_ids field based on the context.
_compute_opt_out: a method that computes the value of opt_out field based on the default list id set in the context.
_search_opt_out: a method that returns a domain to filter contacts based on the value of opt_out field.
create: a method that overrides the default create method to synchronize default_list_ids and subscription_list_ids.
copy: a method that overrides the default copy method to clean the default_list_ids while duplicating airdrop contact in the context of an airdrop list.
name_create: a method that creates a new contact based on a name string and returns its name.
add_to_list: a method that creates a new contact and adds it to an airdrop list.


The model class has the following fields:

name: a required character field that represents the name of the Airdrop List.
active: a boolean field that represents whether the Airdrop List is active or not.
contact_count: an integer field that represents the number of contacts in the Airdrop List. This field is computed by the _compute_airdrop_list_statistics method.
contact_ids: a many-to-many field that represents the contacts in the Airdrop List. This field references the res.partner model, which represents partners in Odoo, and is linked to the airdrop.contact model through a relation table named airdrop_contact_list_rel.
airdrop_count: an integer field that represents the number of airdrops associated with the Airdrop List. This field is computed by the _compute_airdrop_list_count method.
airdrop_ids: a many-to-many field that represents the airdrops associated with the Airdrop List. This field references the airdrop.airdrop model and is linked to the airdrop.list model through a relation table named mail_mass_airdrop_list_rel.
product_id: a many-to-one field that represents the product associated with the Airdrop List. This field references the product.product model.
The model class also has the following methods:

_compute_airdrop_list_count: a method that computes the number of airdrops associated with the Airdrop List.
_compute_airdrop_list_statistics: a method that computes the number of contacts in the Airdrop List and their statistics (such as bounce rate).
write: an ORM override method that prevents archiving used Airdrop Lists.
name_get: a method that returns the name and contact count of the Airdrop Lists.
copy: a method that creates a copy of the Airdrop List.
action_view_contacts: an action method that opens the view of contacts associated with the Airdrop List.
action_view_contacts_email: an action method that opens the view of contacts associated with the Airdrop List and filters them by valid email recipients.
action_view_airdrops: an action method that opens the view of airdrops associated with the Airdrop List.
action_view_contacts_bouncing: an action method that opens the view of contacts associated with the Airdrop List and filters them by bounce.
action_merge: an action method that merges the Airdrop Lists with the given source Airdrop Lists and optionally archives them.
_fetch_contact_statistics: a utility method that computes the number of contacts matching various conditions, such as whether they are opted-out or blacklisted.
_get_contact_statistics_fields: a utility method that returns fields and SQL query select path in a dictionary for computing the contact statistics.
_get_contact_statistics_joins: a utility method that returns the SQL query join for computing the contact statistics.
